<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Class are to be deducted from the code and of the outputs that follows these explanations.
Matrix Class must have seven Class constants: IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ, TRANSLATION and PROJECTION.
The Class’ constructor is consist of an array:
’preset’: the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class constants previoulsy defined.
’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.
’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX, RY or RZ.
’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.
’fov’: projectionfieldofviewindegreesmandatorywhen’preset’isworthPROJECTION. ’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION. ’near’: projection’snearclippingplanemandatorywhen’preset’isworthPROJECTION. ’far’: projection’sfarclippingplanemandatorywhen’preset’isworthPROJECTION.
Verbose to control the displays related to the use of the Class. Verbose is true, then the Class constructor and destructor will produce an output
Methods from the Matrix Class should never modify the current instance.
Matrix Class have at least the following public methods:
Matrix mult( Matrix $rhs ) : returns the multiplication of both matrices. Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx ) : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
